# Dashboard FHIR Pathling
This project is a web application that demonstrates the power of FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) by allowing users to visualize and query synthetic patient data generated by Synthea. The app was developed using the Dash framework and deployed on a Pathling server.

### Background
FHIR is a standard for exchanging healthcare information electronically, developed by HL7 International. It defines a set of resources and data types for healthcare-related information, such as patient records, medications, and diagnostic reports. FHIR is designed to be simple to implement, with a focus on interoperability and the ability to exchange data between different systems.

Synthea is an open-source synthetic patient generator that produces realistic, de-identified patient data for use in healthcare simulation and research. The data is generated using a set of rules and statistics based on real-world patient data. Synthea supports FHIR and can generate data in multiple formats.

Pathling is a data management platform developed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). It is designed to enable researchers to manage and analyze large-scale biomedical data using FHIR resources.

### Getting Started
To use the application, follow these steps:

1) Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/maic01234/dashboard-fhir-pathling.git
```

2) Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine. Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repository and run the following command to start the Docker containers:
```
docker-compose up
```
This will start the Pathling and Python app containers.

3) Open a web browser and go to this address to access the dashboard:
```
http://localhost:8050
```

### Functionality
The dashboard allows users to view patient data in a variety of formats, including charts and tables. The app includes several tabs, each representing a different view of the data:

- Home: displays the arquitecture of this app and generates random data. 
- Visualizacion: make aggregation queries on the FHIR Pathling server and display graphics.
- Descarga: allows user to get data and visualize it on the web and download it as CSV.
